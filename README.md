SUMMARY -> Fifth Project <br>
<br>
First of all, this project taught me a lot in @ keyframes, animations that I want get on my website, using transition and for most important new <br>
pseudoclasses like ::before and ::after. They are very important in modern CSS and SCSS. <br>
Thanks that, now I have strong basics to develop my skills more further and discover more advance thing. <br>
This showed me how much I have to learn and how much I already know. <br>
